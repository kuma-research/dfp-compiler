This is a tiny D\+FP compiler, which can take D\+FP codes input and output optimized ones.

\subsection*{Introduction}

This compiler follows the traditional compiler architecture\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Lexer}\+: Transforms input D\+FP codes into token stream.
\item {\bfseries Parser}\+: Use token stream to build D\+F\+Gs (dataflow graph) and edges. Invalid semantics will cause fatal error while parsing.
\item {\bfseries Optimizer}\+: Including three different optimizers, which are based on canonical simplified data flow analysis algorithms.
\item {\bfseries Printer}\+: Print the D\+FP codes from D\+F\+Gs and edges.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Documentations can be found in {\ttfamily doxygen/}.

\subsubsection*{Codes Structure}

This compiler follows the traditional C++ directory structure\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily src/}\+: C++ source code files, with suffixes {\ttfamily .cc}
\item {\ttfamily include/}\+: C++ header files, with suffixes {\ttfamily .hh}
\item {\ttfamily bin/}\+: C++ objects.
\item {\ttfamily Makefile}\+: Makefile for this compiler.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

There\textquotesingle{}re 4 different modules in this compiler\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily dfp\+\_\+lexer.\+hh(cc)}\+: {\ttfamily class Lexer}\textquotesingle{}s definition and implementations.
\item {\ttfamily dfp\+\_\+parser.\+hh(cc)}\+: {\ttfamily class Parser}\textquotesingle{}s definition and implementations.
\item {\ttfamily dfp\+\_\+program.\+hh(cc)}\+: Internal data structure for D\+FP, including classes like {\ttfamily Graph}, {\ttfamily Node}, {\ttfamily Value} and {\ttfamily Edge}.
\item {\ttfamily dfp.\+hh(cc)}\+: Main class {\ttfamily Compiler}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{System Requirements}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item C++11 enabled compiler, g++ version $>$= 4.\+8 is recommended.
\item No other libraries! Yah!
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{How to Install}

Just use {\ttfamily make all} to build the compiler and other utilities.

\subsection*{Usage}

\subsubsection*{Compiler}

The compiler program is {\ttfamily dfp}. You could simply run it from the command line.

Options\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily -\/f \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}}\+: take input D\+FP codes from file {\ttfamily \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}}
\item {\ttfamily -\/o \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}}\+: output transformed D\+FP codes to file {\ttfamily \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Test and Benchmarks}

There\textquotesingle{}re several benchmarks and examples in the {\ttfamily benchmarks/} directory. Fill free to try them.

And a brief optimization conclusion will be appended\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ ./dfp -f benchmarks/bench04\_general.dfp
2 parsed 2 graphs and 0 edges
3 Opt Report: Format=[graph #id](Binary nodes number) ...
4 Opt pass #0:    g1(5)   g2(3)
5 Opt pass #1:    g1(5)   g2(3)
6 Opt pass #2:    g1(4)   g2(2)
7 Opt pass #3:    g1(1)   g2(2)
\end{DoxyCode}


In this example, there\textquotesingle{}re two graphs (g1 and g2), and the initial number of binary nodes are 5 and 3. After 3 passes of optimization(\#0 is the original one), there\textquotesingle{}re 1 and 2 number of binary nodes left in g1 and g2.
